Briefly explain Syntax and Semantics as use in computer science.

In computer science, syntax and semantics refer to two different aspects of programming languages and other formal languages.

Syntax refers to the set of rules that define the structure and format of a programming language. It specifies how the elements of a language, such as keywords, variables, and operators, can be combined to form valid expressions, statements, and programs. For example, in the C programming language, the syntax for declaring a variable is as follows:

```
data_type variable_name;
```

Here, "data_type" specifies the type of the variable (e.g., int, float, char), and "variable_name" is the name of the variable.

Semantics, on the other hand, refers to the meaning of a programming language. It defines the behavior of the language constructs and how they interact with each other. Semantics determine what a program does when it is executed, based on its syntax. For example, in the C programming language, the semantics of the addition operator (+) define how two numeric values are added together.

In summary, syntax defines the structure and format of a language, while semantics define its meaning and behavior. Both are important aspects of programming languages and must work together to create correct and functional programs.
